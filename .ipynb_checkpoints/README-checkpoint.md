# 06_Python_API_Challenge
- The 6th challenge, based on Python APIs. First I generate a random list of latitudes and longitudes. Then, using Citipy and the OpenWeather API, I found the closest city and created a dataframe with the current weather. Next, I established limits on the weather to locate my ideal climate and the closest hotels in those cities.
